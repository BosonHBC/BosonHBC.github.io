            <b>Summary: </b>This assignment took me around 7 hours including setup. The setup cost me around 3-4 hours and a tiny bug trapped me for 2 hours so the actual coding part could be around 1 hours.

            <b>Bugs remaining: </b> My program only supports sphere input and I still dont know how to use the information stored in Node class properly.
            So in my code I hard coded the three sphere information instead of using info in Node.
            I tried using recersive function in the for loop but the outcome is only a dot, so I stopped trying.
